# dotfiles
Dotfiles for configuration of different software

So far this includes a vimrc and a bash_profile.

Most of the code is either garnered from webcrawling or help files, so feel free to use it as there are no proprietary rights attached.

If you create a really awesome feature that you want to share, send a pull request. I love cool features, especially if they make me more productive.
